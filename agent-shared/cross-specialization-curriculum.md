- **Learning**: Balancing competing priorities

#### Challenge 3: "The User Experience Enhancement"
- **Problem**: User experience needs significant improvement
- **Teams**: 3-4 agents working together
- **Goal**: Enhance UX while maintaining system integrity
- **Learning**: User-centric thinking across domains

### Problem-Solving Framework
1. **Problem Understanding**: Each agent explains the problem from their domain perspective
2. **Constraint Mapping**: Identify constraints and requirements from each domain
3. **Solution Brainstorming**: Generate solutions that satisfy multiple domains
4. **Compromise Finding**: Identify trade-offs and find optimal solutions
5. **Implementation Planning**: Plan how to implement the solution collaboratively

## Module 5: Reflection and Application

### Individual Reflection
Each agent reflects on:
- **New Perspectives**: What did I learn about my partner's role?
- **Challenges**: What challenges did I face in the other role?
- **Insights**: What insights can I apply to my own work?
- **Collaboration**: How can I better support my partner?

### Team Reflection
Each pair reflects on:
- **Communication**: How well did we communicate during the swap?
- **Support**: How well did we support each other?
- **Learning**: What did we learn about collaboration?
- **Improvement**: How can we improve our working relationship?

### Application Planning
- **Immediate Actions**: What can we change right now?
