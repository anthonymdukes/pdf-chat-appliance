# Documentation Strategy & Standards Evaluation

**Evaluator:** Docu the Documentarian (docs-maintainer, system-architect, rule-governor)

## 1. Documentation Structure

### Current State
- **Folders:**
  - `/docs/` — Centralized for reference, policies, architecture, and project-wide guides.
  - `agent-shared/` — Shared logs, training summaries, technical deep dives, overflow, and review artifacts.
  - `training/[role]/learned.md` — Per-agent knowledge logs, deep dives, and enrichment reflections.
  - `session_notes.md` — Chronological, cross-agent session log and workflow memory.
- **Findability:**
  - Most documentation is logically grouped and discoverable for new agents.
  - Naming is consistent (e.g., `learned.md`, `training-day-summary.md`, `advanced-technical-deep-dives.md`).
  - Some overlap between `agent-shared/` and `/docs/` (e.g., technical deep dives, review logs) could be clarified with a README or index file in `agent-shared/`.
- **Document Types:**
  - Changelogs, logs, technical guides, rules, and agent behavior files (`.mdc`) are clearly separated.
  - `.mdc` files are well-scoped in `.cursor/rules/` and not mixed with general docs.

### Recommendations
- Add a `README.md` or `INDEX.md` to `agent-shared/` summarizing the purpose and contents of each file/folder for new contributors.
- Consider a visual map or diagram in `/docs/` showing documentation flow and agent knowledge sources.

## 2. Rules & Compliance

### Current State
- `DOCUMENT_RULES.md` is clear on emoji policy, formatting, and markdownlint requirements.
- Markdownlint rules are enforced and referenced, but not all contributors may know where to find `.markdownlint.json` or how to run checks.
- No formal templates for `.mdc` headers, session notes, or changelog entries.
- Creative identity logging is encouraged but not standardized.

### Recommendations
- Add a section to `DOCUMENT_RULES.md` with:
  - Example `.mdc` file header (role, responsibilities, creative identity, last updated)
  - Session notes template (date, agent, summary, actions, blockers)
  - Changelog entry template (date, file, summary, before/after, reviewer)
  - Creative identity log example (persona, metaphor, visual/UX style)
- Reference `.markdownlint.json` location and basic usage in `DOCUMENT_RULES.md`.
- Consider a pre-commit hook or CI job for markdownlint and spell check.

## 3. Contribution UX

### Current State
- Markdown structure is consistent, but manual formatting is required.
- No automated TOC, spell check, or linting in PR workflow (as visible from docs).
- Most files are easy to edit, but new contributors may not know formatting expectations.

### Recommendations
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md or section in `DOCUMENT_RULES.md` with step-by-step for doc changes.
- Recommend or provide scripts for:
  - Markdownlint (`npx markdownlint .` or similar)
  - Spell check (e.g., `cspell`)
  - TOC generation (e.g., `doctoc`)
- Consider a GitHub Action or CI pipeline for markdownlint, spell check, and TOC validation.

---

## 4. Improvement Proposals

### Consistency
- Standardize templates for `.mdc`, session notes, changelogs, and creative identity logs.
- Add a visual documentation map and agent knowledge flow diagram.

### Contributor Experience
- Provide clear onboarding for doc contributions (CONTRIBUTING.md, templates, automation).
- Automate linting, spell check, and TOC in CI to reduce manual burden.

### Quality & Scalability
- Encourage visual storytelling and UX best practices in technical docs.
- Periodically review and refactor documentation structure as the project grows.
- Use diagrams and visual indexes for complex or cross-domain topics.

## Summary Table

| Area                | Current State | Recommendation |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Structure           | Logical, discoverable | Add agent-shared/README, visual map |
| Rules & Compliance  | Clear, enforced | Add templates, reference lint config |
| Contribution UX     | Manual, consistent | Add onboarding, automate checks |
| Quality/Scalability | High, creative | Visual/UX focus, periodic review |

## Next Steps
- Update `DOCUMENT_RULES.md` with templates and references.
- Add summary to `session_notes.md` under `#docs-eval`.
- Review automation options for markdownlint, spell check, and TOC.
- Add onboarding and visual aids for new contributors.
