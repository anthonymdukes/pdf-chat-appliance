## Gap 1: Governance Complexity Resolution

### 🎯 **Problem Statement**
- **Risk:** Divisional model may create governance silos and fragmented oversight
- **Impact:** Medium - Could delay critical decisions and create coordination issues
- **Current State:** Flat structure with clear escalation via `global-governance.mdc`

### 🧠 **Collaborative Solution: Multi-Tier Governance Model**

#### **Proposed Structure**
```
Enterprise Governance
├── Global Governance (global-governance.mdc) - Ultimate authority
├── Enterprise Architect (enterprise-architect.mdc) - Strategic oversight
├── Division Councils (3 councils, rotating membership)
└── Governance Liaisons (1 per division, rotating quarterly)
```

#### **Detailed Implementation**

- **New Responsibilities:**
  - Divisional oversight and coordination
  - Cross-division policy enforcement
  - Strategic alignment monitoring
  - Governance escalation management
- **Authority:** Reports to `global-governance.mdc`, oversees all divisions

**2. Division Councils (Cross-Functional)**
- **Structure:** 3 councils (Development, Infrastructure, Publishing)
- **Membership:** 3-4 agents per council, rotating quarterly
- **Purpose:** Division-specific decision making and coordination
- **Escalation:** Complex decisions escalate to Enterprise Architect

**3. Governance Liaisons**
- **Role:** One agent per division serves as governance liaison
- **Rotation:** Quarterly rotation to prevent silo formation
