## 1. Alignment Analysis

### ✅ **Strong Alignment Areas**

#### **Divisional Structure Compatibility**
- **Current State:** 25 specialized agents with clear domain boundaries
- **Proposed State:** Domain-aligned divisions (development, infrastructure, publishing)
- **Alignment:** **EXCELLENT** - Our agents naturally cluster into these divisions

**Current Agent Mapping to Proposed Divisions:**
```
/divisions/development-agents/
├── api-builder
├── python-engineer  
├── llm-specialist
├── db-specialist
├── code-review
├── qa-tester
└── senior-dev

/divisions/infrastructure-consulting/
├── deployment-monitor
├── environment
├── security-checks
├── observability
└── system-architect

/divisions/publishing-agents/
├── docs-maintainer
├── repo-management
└── prompt-strategy
```

#### **Shared Services Model**
- **Current State:** Cross-cutting concerns handled by specialized agents
- **Proposed State:** Centralized agent-core for HR, training, EA, docs
- **Alignment:** **EXCELLENT** - We already have these capabilities distributed

**Current Shared Services Mapping:**
```
/agent-core/
├── enterprise-architect (← system-architect enhanced)
├── training-lead (← existing training coordination)
├── hr-coordinator (← new role for agent lifecycle)
└── docs-maintainer (← existing, enhanced)
```

#### **Observability Suite Enhancement**
- **Current State:** Basic observability agent with performance monitoring
- **Proposed State:** Dedicated observability-suite with specialized agents
- **Alignment:** **STRONG** - Natural evolution of current capabilities

**Proposed Observability Structure:**
```
/observability-suite/
├── observability (enhanced)
├── log-aggregator (new)
└── alert-orchestrator (new)
```

### ⚠️ **Alignment Gaps**

#### **Agent Governance Complexity**
- **Gap:** Current flat structure has clear escalation paths via `global-governance.mdc`
- **Risk:** Divisional model may create governance silos
- **Mitigation:** Enhanced cross-division coordination protocols needed

#### **Shared Directory Evolution**
- **Gap:** Current `agent-shared/` serves all agents uniformly
- **Risk:** Divisional structure may fragment shared resources
- **Mitigation:** Maintain unified `shared/agent-shared/` with divisional subdirectories
