# 🧠 AI Collaboration Session Notes (Universal)

This file defines a structured, role-based collaboration model for AI coding assistants. It simulates a multi-agent development team working under human guidance in any project — including CLI tools, APIs, libraries, UI components, infrastructure, or docs.

Use these roles consistently and cycle through them for each feature or sprint.

---

## 🧠 Architect Agent
- Defines high-level system structure, folder layout, and file responsibilities
- Aligns project architecture with goals defined in `PLANNING.md`
- Identifies reusable modules, boundaries, and responsibilities
- May generate diagrams, folder trees, or flowcharts if needed
- Does not implement code directly

---

## 👷 Builder Agent
- Implements code according to Architect's plan and current tasks in `TASK.md`
- Follows language conventions and modular design patterns
- Adds complete docstrings (Google style) for all public functions/classes
- Avoids assumptions — confirms file paths, input formats, or unknowns with the user
- Does not modify architecture or planning files

---

## 🔍 Reviewer Agent
- Reviews AI- or human-generated code for:
  - Modular structure
  - Consistent naming and typing
  - Clear docstrings and comments
  - Conformance to `CURSOR_RULES.md` or project coding standards
- Identifies bugs, bad patterns, and incomplete logic
- Suggests improvements without editing directly unless authorized

---

## 🧪 Tester Agent
- Writes and maintains unit and integration tests
- Ensures test coverage includes:
  - One expected case
  - One edge case
  - One failure case
- Uses `pytest`, `unittest`, or language-appropriate tools
- Places all tests inside the `/tests/` folder matching the target module layout
- Coordinates with Builder to test all new functionality

---

## 📚 Documentation Agent
- Maintains `README.md` with installation, usage, and CLI/API instructions
- Documents features in `/docs/` (if applicable)
- Writes how-to guides, examples, and onboarding content for users or devs
- Updates documentation only after features are reviewed and tested
- Does not modify planning or team coordination files unless asked

---

## 🧾 Logging Agent (Optional)
- Updates this file (`session_notes.md`) with task completions and decisions
- Maintains `CHANGELOG.md` with version or milestone summaries
- Logs multi-agent handoffs and status updates
- Supports async development flows across sessions

## 📋 Session Progress Summary

### 🎯 Objective Completed: PDF Chat Appliance Modularization & Documentation

**Date:** 2025-06-30  
**Session Type:** Full-stack AI engineering team collaboration

### ✅ Completed Work by Role:

#### 🧠 **Architect** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Analyzed current structure and proposed modular improvements
- ✅ Designed new folder structure: `scripts/`, `pdfchat/`, `config/`, `tests/`, `docs/`
- ✅ Proposed Typer-based CLI structure (`pdfchat.py`)
- ✅ Defined modular boundaries and responsibilities

#### 📚 **DocumentationAgent** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Rewrote `README.md` with professional multi-section format
- ✅ Created `docs/usage.md` with workflow and API documentation
- ✅ Created `docs/architecture.md` with system overview and Mermaid diagram
- ✅ Added installation, usage, configuration, and deployment sections

#### 👷 **Builder** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created modular `pdfchat/` package structure:
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization and exports
  - `config.py` - Centralized configuration management
  - `ingestion.py` - PDF loading, chunking, and embedding
  - `server.py` - Flask-based API server
  - `utils.py` - Shared utility functions
- ✅ Moved original scripts to `scripts/` folder
- ✅ Created Typer-based CLI (`pdfchat.py`) with commands:
  - `pdfchat ingest <folder>` - PDF ingestion
  - `pdfchat serve [--host --port]` - Start server
  - `pdfchat config [show|edit|reset]` - Configuration management
  - `pdfchat version` - Version information
- ✅ Created `config/default.yaml` with default settings
- ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` with new dependencies (typer, pyyaml, pytest)

#### 🧪 **Tester** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `tests/` package structure
- ✅ Created `tests/test_config.py` with comprehensive test cases:
  - Expected use case: default configuration
  - Edge case: custom configuration values
  - Failure case: non-existent YAML file
- ✅ Created `tests/test_utils.py` with utility function tests:
  - Expected use case: directory creation and PDF validation
  - Edge case: existing directories and response formatting
  - Failure case: non-existent files and directories

#### 🧾 **LoggingAgent** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Updated `session_notes.md` with progress summary
- ✅ Documented all role handoffs and completed work
