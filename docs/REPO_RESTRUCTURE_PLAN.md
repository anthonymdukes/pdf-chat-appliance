# Repository Restructure Plan

**Date:** 2025-07-06  
**Status:** Planning Document  
**Scope:** Repository structure reorganization and its impact on documentation system

---

## Current State Analysis

### Documentation Structure
- **`/docs/`** - Centralized reference, policies, architecture, and project-wide guides
- **`agent-shared/`** - Shared logs, training summaries, technical deep dives, overflow, and review artifacts
- **`training/[role]/learned.md`** - Per-agent knowledge logs, deep dives, and enrichment reflections
- **`session_notes.md`** - Chronological, cross-agent session log and workflow memory

### Identified Issues
1. **Mixed Documentation Locations:** Some overlap between `/docs/` and `agent-shared/`
2. **Discoverability Challenges:** New agents may struggle to find relevant documentation
3. **Inconsistent Organization:** Different patterns across documentation types
4. **Scalability Concerns:** Current structure may not support future growth

```

### Key Changes

#### 1. Documentation Consolidation
- **Move:** Technical deep dives from `agent-shared/` to `docs/architecture/`
- **Move:** Review artifacts from `agent-shared/` to `agent-shared/reviews/`
- **Move:** Training summaries from `agent-shared/` to `agent-shared/training/`
- **Create:** Clear separation between project docs and agent artifacts

#### 2. Agent Memory Organization
- **Create:** Dedicated `agent-memory/` directory for persistent agent state
- **Organize:** Database files, embeddings, logs, and session data
- **Separate:** Agent memory from shared collaboration artifacts

#### 3. Training Structure Enhancement
- **Enhance:** Role-specific training directories with subdirectories
- **Add:** Skills tracking and assessment capabilities
- **Create:** Shared training resources directory

#### 4. Improved Navigation
- **Add:** README files in each major directory
- **Create:** Index files for easy discovery
- **Implement:** Visual documentation maps

## Impact Assessment

### Documentation System Impact

#### Database Schema Updates
- **File Path Changes:** Update file discovery and indexing paths
- **Metadata Updates:** Adjust metadata extraction for new structure
- **Relationship Mapping:** Update relationship detection algorithms
- **Search Indexes:** Rebuild search indexes for new organization

#### Integration Points
- **Agent Workflows:** Update agent file access patterns
- **Session Tracking:** Adjust session activity logging paths
- **Backup Systems:** Update backup and recovery procedures
- **Monitoring:** Adjust monitoring and alerting configurations

#### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Create new directory structure
- **Phase 2:** Move files to new locations
- **Phase 3:** Update references and links
- **Phase 4:** Validate and test new structure

### Agent Workflow Impact

#### File Access Patterns
- **Current:** Mixed access to `/docs/`, `agent-shared/`, `training/`
- **Future:** Clear separation with dedicated access patterns
