## Assignment Management

### Assignment Types

#### Primary Assignment
- Agent's main project focus
- Full-time commitment to project goals
- Primary responsibility for project deliverables

#### Cross-Project Assignment
- Agent serves multiple projects
- Shared infrastructure and governance roles
- Reduced time allocation per project

#### Temporary Assignment
- Short-term project needs
- Trial periods or experimental roles
- Temporary workload spikes

### Assignment Rules

#### Workload Distribution
- **Primary Assignment**: 80-100% time allocation
- **Cross-Project Assignment**: 20-40% time allocation per project
- **Temporary Assignment**: Variable time allocation based on need

#### Assignment Criteria
- **Skill Match**: Agent specialization aligns with project needs
- **Availability**: Agent has capacity for additional assignments
- **Project Priority**: Higher priority projects get preference
- **Performance History**: Past performance influences assignment decisions

#### Assignment Transitions
- **New Assignment**: Requires hr-coordinator approval and system-architect validation
- **Assignment Change**: Requires 2-week notice and knowledge transfer planning
- **Assignment End**: Requires completion documentation and handoff procedures

## Assignment Tracking
