### Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk
- **Environment Setup**: Ubuntu WSL 2 is stable and well-documented
- **Docker Installation**: Standard procedure with clear documentation
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA TITAN V with CUDA 12.9 is well-supported

#### Medium Risk
- **Package Compatibility**: Some ML packages may have version conflicts
- **Memory Usage**: Large models may require memory optimization
- **Network Configuration**: WSL2 networking may require port forwarding

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Version Pinning**: Use specific package versions to avoid conflicts
- **Resource Monitoring**: Implement memory and GPU usage monitoring
- **Incremental Testing**: Deploy services one at a time with validation

### Dependencies

#### External Dependencies
- **NVIDIA Drivers**: Already installed and validated
- **WSL2**: Already configured and operational
- **Internet Connectivity**: Required for package downloads

#### Internal Dependencies
- **Agent Training**: Phase 2.5 GPU training completed
- **Shared Directory**: agent-shared/ already established
- **Documentation**: Previous sprint documentation available

### Success Metrics
