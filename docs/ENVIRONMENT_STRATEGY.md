```

### **Workflow 2: Performance Optimization**
```
1. Windows: Define performance benchmarks and targets
2. WSL: Execute performance tests with GPU acceleration
3. agent-shared/: Store benchmark results and metrics
4. Windows: Analyze performance data and identify optimizations
5. WSL: Implement and test optimizations
6. Docker: Validate optimizations in production-like environment
```

### **Workflow 3: Security Validation**
```
1. Windows: Define security requirements and test cases
2. WSL: Execute security scans and vulnerability assessments
3. agent-shared/: Store security reports and findings
4. Windows: Analyze security results and plan remediation
5. Docker: Test security fixes in isolated environment
```

### **Workflow 4: API Development and Testing**
```
1. Windows: API design and documentation

## Shared Directory Integration

### **Cross-Environment Memory**
- **Persistent State:** `agent-shared/` maintains state across environments
- **Artifact Storage:** Logs, test results, and debug files
- **Handoff Coordination:** Seamless transition between environments
- **Collaboration Space:** Inter-agent communication and data sharing

### **File Organization**
- **logs/:** Execution logs and traces from all environments
- **test-results/:** Test outputs and benchmarks
- **model-outputs/:** LLM responses and embeddings
- **debug-files/:** Debug artifacts and trace files
- **ingestion-data/:** PDF processing and chunking outputs
- **api-data/:** FastAPI request/response logs
- **cross-agent/:** Inter-agent communication artifacts
- **temp/:** Temporary files (auto-cleanup)

### **Naming Conventions**
- **Format:** `[category]_[agent]_[timestamp]_[description].[extension]`
- **Example:** `test_result_qa-tester_20250706_143022_pyright_scan.json`
- **Timestamp:** `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` for traceability

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Agent Awareness**
- All agents must understand multi-environment execution model
- Agents must store cross-boundary artifacts in `agent-shared/`
- Agents must recognize optimal environment for each task
- Agents must coordinate handoffs between environments

### **Execution Policy: Unrestricted**
- **Policy:** Unrestricted â€” agents may run any required PowerShell or WSL commands without user prompts
- **Scope:** Trusted, isolated, non-production workstation environment
- **Security:** Security constraints lifted for agent-controlled automation
- **Validation:** Agents must validate execution context and log outputs to session_notes.md when operating cross-environment
- **Responsibility:** Agents must choose optimal runtime based on performance, realism, or portability

### **Environment Validation**
- Regular validation of cross-environment access
- Performance testing across all environments
- Security validation in isolated environments
- Documentation of environment-specific requirements

### **Monitoring and Observability**
- Cross-environment logging and monitoring
- Performance metrics across all environments
- Error tracking and debugging across boundaries
- Resource utilization monitoring
