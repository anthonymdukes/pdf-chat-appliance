# üìã Script Compliance & Terminal Prompt Unsticking

> **PDF Chat Appliance - Script Standards & Best Practices**

> Last updated: 2025-07-03

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the standards for all scripts in the PDF Chat Appliance project to ensure proper terminal behavior and prevent "prompt sticking" issues in integrated development environments (IDEs) like VS Code and Cursor.

---

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** After executing scripts or processes, the terminal prompt often "sticks" on a blank line, requiring manual Enter key presses to get the next prompt.

**Root Cause:** Multiple factors contribute to prompt sticking:

1. **Missing output flushing:** Scripts not explicitly outputting final blank lines
2. **Orphaned processes:** PowerShell jobs, Docker processes, and background threads not properly terminated
3. **Subprocess management:** Child processes leaving hanging handles
4. **Integrated terminal behavior:** VS Code/Cursor terminals requiring explicit cleanup

**Impact:**

- Reduced developer productivity
- Confusion about script completion status
- Manual intervention required for workflow continuation
- Inconsistent behavior across different execution paths

---

## Solution: Comprehensive Exit Flushing & Process Cleanup

### **PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)**

```powershell
# CORRECT: Explicit blank line at exit points
Write-Host "Script completed successfully"
Write-Host ""

# CORRECT: Multiple exit points covered
if ($success) {
    Write-Host "SUCCESS: Operation completed"
    Write-Host ""
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "ERROR: Operation failed"
    Write-Host ""
    exit 1
}

# CRITICAL: Unconditional cleanup and prompt unsticking
Write-Host ""

# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP: Remove any orphaned PowerShell jobs
Get-Job -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Job -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### **Python Scripts (.py)**

```python
# CORRECT: Explicit blank line at exit points
print("Script completed successfully")
print()

# CORRECT: Multiple exit points covered
if success:
    print("SUCCESS: Operation completed")
    print()
    sys.exit(0)
else:
    print("ERROR: Operation failed")
    print()
    sys.exit(1)

# CORRECT: Main execution block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print()  # Ensure prompt unsticking

# CRITICAL: Unconditional cleanup and prompt unsticking
print()

# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP: Ensure all threads and processes are properly terminated
import atexit
import signal
import os

def cleanup_on_exit():
    """Ensure clean exit by terminating any remaining processes"""
    try:
        # Force flush all output
        import sys
        sys.stdout.flush()
        sys.stderr.flush()
        
        # Print final blank line
        print()
    except:
        pass

# Register cleanup function
atexit.register(cleanup_on_exit)
```

### **Bash Scripts (.sh)**

```bash
# CORRECT: Explicit blank line at exit points
echo "Script completed successfully"
echo ""

# CORRECT: Multiple exit points covered
if [ $success -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "SUCCESS: Operation completed"
    echo ""
    exit 0
else
    echo "ERROR: Operation failed"
    echo ""
    exit 1
fi

# CRITICAL: Unconditional cleanup and prompt unsticking
echo ""

# COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP: Kill any background processes
trap 'kill $(jobs -p) 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
```

## Compliance Audit Results

### **COMPLIANT SCRIPTS**

| Script | Type | Status | Exit Points |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `scripts/health-check.ps1` | PowerShell | Compliant | `Write-Host ""` at all exits |
| `scripts/agent-run.ps1` | PowerShell | Compliant | `Write-Host ""` at all exits |
| `scripts/deployment-validation.ps1` | PowerShell | Compliant | `Write-Host ""` at all exits |
| `scripts/enterprise_performance_test.py` | Python | Compliant | `print()` at all exits |
| `scripts/embed_all.py` | Python | Compliant | `print()` at all exits |
| `scripts/setup.sh` | Bash | Compliant | `echo ""` at all exits |
| `run_server.py` | Python | Fixed | `print()` added |

### **REMEDIATION ACTIONS TAKEN**

1. **`run_server.py`** - Added `print()` at main execution exit
2. **`scripts/embed_all.py`** - Enhanced with additional `print()` for clarity
3. **All PowerShell scripts** - Added comprehensive job cleanup and unconditional `Write-Host ""`
4. **All Python scripts** - Added `atexit` cleanup handlers and unconditional `print()`
5. **All Bash scripts** - Added process cleanup traps and unconditional `echo ""`

## Implementation Standards

### **Required Patterns**

#### **PowerShell Scripts**

```powershell
# 1. Function exit points
function My-Function {
    # ... function logic ...
    Write-Host "Function completed"
    Write-Host ""
}

# 2. Script exit points
if ($condition) {
    Write-Host "SUCCESS: Condition met"
    Write-Host ""
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "ERROR: Condition failed"
    Write-Host ""
    exit 1
}

# 3. Main execution end
Write-Host "Script execution complete"
Write-Host ""
```

#### **Python Scripts**

```python
# 1. Function exit points
def my_function():
    # ... function logic ...
    print("Function completed")
    print()

# 2. Script exit points
if condition:
    print("SUCCESS: Condition met")
    print()
    sys.exit(0)
else:
    print("ERROR: Condition failed")
    print()
    sys.exit(1)

# 3. Main execution end
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print()
```

#### **Bash Scripts**

```bash
# 1. Function exit points
my_function() {
    # ... function logic ...
    echo "Function completed"
    echo ""
}

# 2. Script exit points
if [ $condition -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "SUCCESS: Condition met"
    echo ""
    exit 0
else
    echo "ERROR: Condition failed"
    echo ""
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Main execution end
echo "Script execution complete"
echo ""
```

## üîç Pre-Commit Checks

### **Required Validations**

- [ ] All exit points have explicit blank line output
- [ ] No orphaned processes or jobs left running
- [ ] Proper error handling with exit codes
- [ ] Consistent output formatting across all scripts
- [ ] Terminal prompt unsticking verified

---

## Testing Protocol

1. Run script in integrated terminal environment
2. Verify prompt returns immediately after completion
3. Test error conditions and exit paths
4. Confirm no background processes remain
5. Validate output formatting consistency

---

## ü§ñ Automated Validation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated script compliance checker

check_script() {
    local script="$1"
    local ext="${script##*.}"
    
    case $ext in
        "ps1")
            # Check for Write-Host "" patterns
            if grep -q 'Write-Host ""' "$script"; then
                echo "PASS: $script: PowerShell compliance verified"
            else
                echo "FAIL: $script: Missing Write-Host \"\" patterns"
            fi
            ;;
        "py")
            # Check for print() patterns
            if grep -q 'print()' "$script"; then
                echo "PASS: $script: Python compliance verified"
            else
                echo "FAIL: $script: Missing print() patterns"
            fi
            ;;
        "sh")
            # Check for echo "" patterns
            if grep -q 'echo ""' "$script"; then
                echo "PASS: $script: Bash compliance verified"
            else
                echo "FAIL: $script: Missing echo \"\" patterns"
            fi
            ;;
    esac
}

# Check all scripts in the project
find scripts/ -name "*.ps1" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" | while read script; do
    check_script "$script"
done
```

        sys.stdout.flush()
        sys.stderr.flush()
        
        # Print final blank line
