#### Automated Code Review System
```python
# automated_code_review.py
import subprocess
import json
import os
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum

class ReviewStatus(Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    CHANGES_REQUESTED = "changes_requested"
    COMMENTED = "commented"

class IssueSeverity(Enum):
    LOW = "low"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    HIGH = "high"
    CRITICAL = "critical"

@dataclass
class CodeIssue:
    file_path: str
    line_number: int
    severity: IssueSeverity
    message: str
    rule_id: str
    category: str
    fix_suggestion: Optional[str] = None

class AutomatedCodeReviewer:
    def __init__(self, project_root: str):
        self.project_root = project_root
        self.review_results: Dict[str, ReviewResult] = {}
        
    def run_ruff_analysis(self, file_path: str) -> List[CodeIssue]:
        """Run Ruff static analysis on a file"""
        issues = []
        
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ['ruff', 'check', '--output-format=json', file_path],
                capture_output=True,
                text=True,
                cwd=self.project_root
            )
            
            if result.returncode == 0:
                return issues  # No issues found
            
            # Parse Ruff output
            try:
                ruff_output = json.loads(result.stdout)
                for issue in ruff_output:
                    issues.append(CodeIssue(
                        file_path=issue.get('filename', file_path),
                        line_number=issue.get('location', {}).get('row', 0),
                        severity=self._map_ruff_severity(issue.get('code', '')),
                        message=issue.get('message', ''),
                        rule_id=issue.get('code', ''),
                        category='style',
                        fix_suggestion=issue.get('fix', {}).get('message', '')
                    ))
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                pass
        
        except Exception as e:
            issues.append(CodeIssue(
                file_path=file_path,
                line_number=0,
                severity=IssueSeverity.HIGH,
                message=f"Error running Ruff analysis: {e}",
                rule_id='ERROR',
                category='system'
            ))
        
        return issues
```

#### Code Review Workflow Integration
```python
# review_workflow.py
import requests
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ReviewComment:
    path: str
    line: int
    message: str
    suggestion: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class PullRequestReview:
    pr_number: int
    status: str  # APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED
    comments: List[ReviewComment]
    body: str

class GitHubReviewIntegration:
    def __init__(self, token: str, owner: str, repo: str):
        self.token = token
        self.owner = owner
        self.repo = repo
        self.base_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}"
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"token {token}",
            "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
        }
    
    def get_review_templates(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Get review templates for different scenarios"""
        return {
            "approval": "‚úÖ Code review completed. All checks passed. Ready for merge.",
            "minor_changes": "‚ö†Ô∏è Minor issues found. Please address the comments before merging.",
