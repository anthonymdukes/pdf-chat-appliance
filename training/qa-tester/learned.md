## CLI Examples & Cheat Sheets

### Ruff Configuration
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"
line-length = 88
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "T20", "T201"]
ignore = ["E501"]

[tool.ruff.test]
# Test-specific configurations
```

### pytest Configuration
```ini
# pytest.ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
addopts = --strict-markers --strict-config
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
```

### Performance Testing
```python
# test_performance.py
import pytest
from pytest_benchmark.fixture import BenchmarkFixture

def test_ingestion_performance(benchmark: BenchmarkFixture):
    def ingestion_operation():
        # Test ingestion logic here
        pass
    
    result = benchmark(ingestion_operation)
    assert result.stats.mean < 0.1  # 100ms threshold
```
