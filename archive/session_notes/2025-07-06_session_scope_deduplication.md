## SCOPE DEDUPLICATION & SELF-REALIGNMENT INITIATIVE

**Date:** 2025-07-06  
**Initiative:** Strategic scope deduplication before new agent creation  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Coordinator:** agent-orchestrator

### Purpose
Before creating new agents (build-manager, release-coordinator, product-lifecycle-manager), resolve role duplication and realign existing agents to ensure clean, well-scoped organization.

### Required Action
All impacted agents must post self-realignment responses using the specified format.

### Format Template
```markdown
📝 agent: [agent-name]  
- redundant-with: [agents with overlap]  
- realigned-scope: [what you are removing/handing off]  
- new-focus: [your refined scope going forward]  
- coordination-needed: [agents to sync with]  
- status: [realignment-complete/pending]
```

### Submission Status
- **Completed:** All 25 agents have submitted self-realignment responses
- **Deadline:** Met - Before new agent creation begins
- **Next Phase:** rule-governor approval → hr-coordinator logging → agent-orchestrator readiness signal

### Coordination Flow
1. **agent-orchestrator** - Coordinates the deduplication process
2. **rule-governor** - Approves final .mdc changes
3. **hr-coordinator** - Logs status in hr-roster.md and validates clean scopes
4. **docs-maintainer** - Reflects all final scopes in TEAM_STRUCTURE.md
