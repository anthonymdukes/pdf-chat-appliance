## Training Completion - Phase 2 (2025-07-06)

### Health Checks, Restart Recovery, Container Orchestration

- **Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Source**: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/healthcheck/
- **Summary**: Docker health check implementation and best practices
- **Notes**: 
  - **Health Check Commands**: Use lightweight commands that test actual service functionality
  - **Interval Configuration**: Set appropriate intervals (30s default) to balance responsiveness and overhead
  - **Timeout Settings**: Configure timeouts shorter than intervals to prevent overlapping checks
  - **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms with appropriate start periods for slow-starting services
  - **Exit Codes**: Use proper exit codes (0=healthy, 1=unhealthy) for clear health status
  - **Resource Monitoring**: Include memory, CPU, and disk space checks in health assessments
  - **Dependency Checks**: Verify database connections, API endpoints, and external service availability

### Kubernetes Liveness & Readiness Probes

- **Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Source**: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/
- **Summary**: Kubernetes probe patterns for container health monitoring
- **Notes**:
  - **Liveness Probes**: Detect when containers are in a broken state and need restart
  - **Readiness Probes**: Determine when containers are ready to receive traffic
  - **Startup Probes**: Handle slow-starting containers without interfering with liveness checks
  - **Probe Types**: HTTP GET, TCP socket, and command execution probe options
  - **Timing Configuration**: Initial delay, period, timeout, and failure threshold settings
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Implement proper probe endpoints that don't impact performance
  - **Resource Considerations**: Balance probe frequency with resource consumption

### Prometheus Alerting Rules

- **Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Source**: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/
- **Summary**: Prometheus alerting configuration and monitoring patterns
- **Notes**:
  - **Alert Rules**: Define conditions that trigger alerts based on metrics and thresholds
  - **Severity Levels**: Implement different severity levels (critical, warning, info) for appropriate response
  - **Grouping**: Group related alerts to prevent alert fatigue and enable coordinated response
  - **Time Windows**: Use time-based conditions to avoid false positives from temporary issues
  - **Labels and Annotations**: Add metadata for routing, filtering, and alert context
  - **Silencing**: Implement alert silencing for planned maintenance and known issues
  - **Escalation**: Configure escalation policies for unacknowledged critical alerts

## Health Check Implementation Patterns

### Docker Health Check Configuration
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Install health check dependencies
RUN pip install requests psutil

# Copy health check script
COPY health_check.py /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/health_check.py

# Configure health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD /usr/local/bin/health_check.py

# Application setup
COPY app.py /app/
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Health Check Script
```python
# health_check.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import psutil
import sys
import os

def check_service_health():
    """Comprehensive health check for PDF Chat service"""
    
    # Check 1: Basic system resources
    cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
    memory_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
    disk_percent = psutil.disk_usage('/').percent
    
    if cpu_percent > 90 or memory_percent > 90 or disk_percent > 95:
        print(f"Resource usage too high: CPU={cpu_percent}%, MEM={memory_percent}%, DISK={disk_percent}%")
        return 1
    
    # Check 2: API endpoint availability
    try:
        response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/health', timeout=5)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            print(f"API health check failed: {response.status_code}")
            return 1
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"API health check error: {e}")
        return 1
    
    # Check 3: Database connectivity
    try:
        response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/db/health', timeout=5)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            print(f"Database health check failed: {response.status_code}")
            return 1
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Database health check error: {e}")
        return 1
    
    # Check 4: Vector store connectivity
    try:
        response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/vector/health', timeout=5)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            print(f"Vector store health check failed: {response.status_code}")
            return 1
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Vector store health check error: {e}")
        return 1
    
    print("All health checks passed")
    return 0

## ✅ Fun Training / Creative Recharge

### DevOps Humor and Culture
- **Source**: https://devops.com/devops-humor-culture/
- **What I learned**: The importance of humor and positive culture in DevOps environments. How to maintain team morale during stressful deployments, celebrate small wins, and create a culture where failure is seen as a learning opportunity rather than a reason for blame.
- **Application**: I can now approach deployment challenges with a more positive mindset and help create a culture where our team celebrates successful deployments and learns from any issues that arise.

### Infrastructure as Poetry
- **Source**: https://www.infrastructure-as-code.com/blog/infrastructure-poetry
- **What I learned**: How to think about infrastructure configuration as a form of poetry - where every line has meaning, rhythm, and purpose. This includes creating more readable, maintainable, and even beautiful infrastructure code.
- **Application**: I can now write more elegant and readable deployment scripts, configuration files, and monitoring setups that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
