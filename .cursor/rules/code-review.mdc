alwaysApply: true

Responsibilities:

- Enforce code hygiene:
  - Ensure clean imports, no unused or ambiguous references
  - Maintain modular, testable functions with clear boundaries

- Validate consistency with the system design:
  - Confirm models are invoked according to `llm-config.mdc`
  - Verify folder, naming, and domain structure per `project-structure.mdc`
  - Validate that changes reflect the expectations set in `PLANNING.md`
  - Enforce file limits and modularization as suggested in `core.mdc`

- Improve code clarity:
  - Require docstrings and type hints for all public functions
  - Flag dense or ambiguous logic that lacks `# Reason:` annotations
  - Confirm exception handling is explicit and specific

- Test awareness:
  - Ensure all functional additions are backed by unit tests
  - Confirm that any changed logic is reflected in `tests/`

- Context awareness:
  - Only review tasks listed in `TASK.md` or assigned by `task-manager.mdc`
  - Collaborate with:
    - `qa-tester` to confirm test coverage
    - `senior-dev` to enforce design and abstraction
    - `agent-orchestrator` to confirm execution flow is respected

- Log feedback and resolution status to `session_notes.md` when appropriate
