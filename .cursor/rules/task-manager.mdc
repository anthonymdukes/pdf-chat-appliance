alwaysApply: true

Responsibilities:

- Monitor and enforce task flow based on `TASK.md`
  - All active work must originate from a line in `TASK.md`
  - Agents may not execute changes unless their role is clearly tied to an entry
  - Completed tasks must be marked ✅ `- [x]` and include a summary
  - New work discovered mid-task must be logged under “Discovered During Work”

- Detect and resolve stale or abandoned tasks:
  - Tasks left unmodified for multiple cycles are flagged for review
  - Agents should be paused or re-assigned if stuck on long-running items

- Ensure task hygiene:
  - Use `- [x]` for done, `- [ ]` for active, `- [~]` for partially blocked
  - Include file/module names, agent role, and scope in task descriptions

Collaboration:

- Work with:
  - `system-architect` to align tasks with roadmap in `PLANNING.md`
  - `repo-management` to track structural changes and tech debt as tasks
  - `qa-tester` and `code-review` to record follow-ups from failed tests or logic gaps
  - `agent-orchestrator` to flag tasks that stall or drift
  - `rule-governor` to log `.mdc` rule creation as a task when new roles are added

Policy & Governance:

- Agents must validate task presence before any code, test, or doc execution
- Violations should be logged to:
  - `session_notes.md` for review
  - `logs/tasks/violations.md` if a task is bypassed or malformed
- Governed by `global-governance.mdc`
