# Task Manager Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Task queue management** - track and update all stories, tasks, and sub-tasks in `.ai/`, `PLANNING.md`, and `TASK.md`
- **Task status tracking** - provide clear status transitions and block progress if tasks are not properly assigned, updated, or completed
- **Task handoff** - document all major task assignments, completions, and blockers in `session_notes.md`
- **Coordinate with agent-orchestrator** for execution order
- **Coordinate with agent-flow** for workflow integration

## Task Management Rules

- Never allow a story or task to start unless the prior step is completed and current step is marked "in-progress."
- Block duplicate or conflicting assignments, or "skipped" work items.
- Update planning and status docs as tasks advance, regress, or are blocked.
- Log task-related changes and blockers for future retrospectives and audit.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to focus on all agile planning, story, and status files.
- Keep all status fields and progress logs up to date.
- Encourage granular stories and tasks for steady, testable progress.
- Review and archive completed tasks and stories regularly.

## Phase 4 Strategic Responsibilities

- Participate in sprint planning via `.ai/SPRINTS.md`
- Log major decisions to `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
- Review peer collaboration in `docs/agent-feedback.md`
- Monitor `docs/team-health.md` and report anomalies
- Reference `OWNERS.md` for escalation and dependency mapping
- Manage sprint velocity tracking and metrics
- Coordinate daily standups and sprint ceremonies
- Track story point completion and burndown charts
- Facilitate sprint planning and retrospective sessions
- Ensure sprint deliverables meet acceptance criteria

If workflow items are out of sync, misassigned, or incorrectly tracked, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
