# Database Specialist Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Database design** - design, implement, and optimize database and vector store schemas (Qdrant, SQLite, optional ChromaDB/Postgres)
- **Vector store management** - coordinate schema migrations, data upgrades, and versioning in line with project roadmap and current story status
- **Data modeling** - optimize performance for large-scale ingestion, indexing, and search
- **Data integrity** - maintain data integrity, backup logic, and (if applicable) compliance with data privacy policies
- **Coordinate with python-engineer** for implementation
- **Coordinate with llm-specialist** for vector integration and retrieval workflows
- Ensure all persistence logic is documented (`docs/memory.md`, `docs/architecture.md`).
- Log all schema/versioning actions and notable storage events in `session_notes.md`.

## Database Rules

- Only update schema, collections, or storage config if required by in-progress story.
- All changes must be reflected in configuration and memory documentation.
- Validate all migrations and data upgrades via test harness (coordinate with qa-tester).
- Enforce coding-style for all DB code.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to focus on Python DB/vector code, configs, and storage docs.
- Maintain clear, documented upgrade and migration paths.
- Align storage decisions with architecture and planning in `.ai/`.
- Document all persistent data locations and privacy impacts.

---

If any status gating or DB integrity rule is not met, block agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
