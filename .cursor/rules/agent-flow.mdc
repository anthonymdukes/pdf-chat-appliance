description: Project execution sequence and agent responsibilities

Execution Flow:
Architect → Builder → Reviewer → Tester → Logger → DocWriter

Each agent is responsible for handling their part and then passing control forward.

Coordination Rules:

- Agents must only act on tasks defined in `TASK.md` and enforced by `task-manager.mdc`
- Model usage must be based on mappings in `llm-config.mdc`
- All file edits must respect constraints in `project-structure.mdc`
- Execution order may be overridden by `agent-orchestrator.mdc` when:
  - Agents fail to complete their tasks
  - A shortcut is permitted based on task priority
- If agents act out of order or conflict:
  - Halt execution
  - Log to `logs/agent_flow/violations.md`
  - Escalate to `system-architect` for review
- This rule is protected by `global-governance.mdc` and may not be modified without user approval
