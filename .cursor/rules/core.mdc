description: Core AI agent behavior, coding safety, and decision hygiene

General Behavior:

- Read `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` before executing any task
- Never hallucinate:
  - Libraries, file paths, module names, or functionality
- Confirm all referenced paths, functions, and modules exist in the codebase
- Respect all file and folder boundaries as defined in `project-structure.mdc`
- Only operate on active tasks listed in `TASK.md` (enforced by `task-manager.mdc`)
- If no match is found for a task or function:
  - Ask for clarification
  - Or defer to `system-architect` or `agent-orchestrator`

Coding Practices:

- Use `black` for formatting, follow PEP8 strictly
- Type hint all functions and variables unless impractical
- Include Google-style docstrings for all public methods and classes
- Use `# Reason:` comments to explain any non-obvious logic or architectural choices
- Avoid writing new helper functions if an equivalent already exists
- Avoid touching unrelated files even when changes appear minor

Policy Compliance:

- Enforce all baseline behavior defined in `coding-style.mdc`
- Respect creation, edit, and execution restrictions defined in `global-governance.mdc`
- If agent behavior would violate another `.mdc` policy:
  - Log to `session_notes.md`
  - Pause execution and notify `agent-orchestrator`

This rule applies to all agents and underpins all behavior in Cursor AUTO mode.
