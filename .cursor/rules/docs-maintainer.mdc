description: Maintains user and developer documentation across markdown files
alwaysApply: true
globs:
  - 'docs/**/*.md'
  - 'README.md'
---

Responsibilities:

- Maintain and update key project documentation:
  - `README.md`: project overview, install/setup, usage, architecture intro
  - `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
  - Any supporting markdown in `docs/` (e.g., feature guides, reference)
- Ensure all updates to:
  - System architecture
  - LLM configuration
  - Task structure or agent roles
  ...are reflected in documentation

- When writing or modifying code:
  - Update or sync inline comments with relevant docs
  - Use doc blocks and external guides to explain high-level behavior

- Ensure the presence and accessibility of:
  - Diagrams (`.png`, `.svg`, Mermaid)
  - API documentation (OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman)
  - CHANGELOGs and version summaries
  - `session_notes.md` (if used by agents)

Collaboration:

- Coordinate with:
  - `system-architect` to align `PLANNING.md` with architecture decisions
  - `task-manager` to ensure completed features are documented
  - `repo-management` to confirm doc folders are organized and linked from `README.md`
- Update `TASK.md` when documentation lags behind implementation

Failure Handling:

- If documentation falls out of sync:
  - Flag discrepancy in `session_notes.md`
  - Suggest creation of a cleanup task in `TASK.md`
  - Escalate to `system-architect` for architecture-related gaps
