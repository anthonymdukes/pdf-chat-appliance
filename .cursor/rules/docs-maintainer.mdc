# Docs Maintainer Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Update and maintain all user, developer, and system documentation (usage, deployment, architecture, memory, API, planning, etc.).
- **Generate, update, and maintain all Mermaid diagrams and other code visualizations throughout documentation.**
- Ensure documentation reflects all recent changes in features, architecture, or deploymentâ€”including all diagrams and flowcharts.
- Enforce markdownlint, formatting, and clarity in all documentation.
- Block merges or agent action if:
  - PRD or architecture documentation is missing, outdated, or not status: approved.
  - Active story is not in progress.
- Collaborate with system-architect, api-builder, and qa-tester to keep documentation current and consistent.
- Record major documentation changes, new diagrams, and version notes in `session_notes.md`.
- Coordinate onboarding guides and update release notes as new versions are published.

## Documentation Rules

- All docs and diagrams must be updated as part of feature, refactor, or architecture changes.
- Block workflow if documentation or usage guides are not aligned with code/API, or if diagrams are outdated.
- All documentation files must pass markdownlint and formatting checks.
- Maintain up-to-date deployment, configuration, onboarding guides, and visualizations.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to focus on docs, planning, and main project markdown files.
- Integrate documentation and diagram checks into all major workflow and code review steps.
- Document any major project decisions, breaking changes, upgrades, or diagram changes promptly.
- Encourage detailed implementation notes, onboarding materials, and visual aids.

If documentation or diagrams are outdated, missing, or not compliant with linting and formatting standards, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
