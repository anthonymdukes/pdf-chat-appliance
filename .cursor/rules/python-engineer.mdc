# Python Engineer Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Core Python development** - design, implement, and refactor all core Python modules, backend logic, CLI, and supporting tools
- **Code refactoring** - ensure all code aligns with architecture, agile gating, and project requirements
- **Utility functions** - write and update unit/integration tests for all features (coordinate with qa-tester)
- **Implementation optimization** - suggest Pythonic optimizations and new patterns as the project evolves
- **Coordinate with api-builder** for API implementation
- **Coordinate with senior-dev** for architectural guidance and migrations

## Python Engineering Rules

- Only implement or refactor code if approved in current epic/story.
- All code changes must be tested, reviewed, and documented.
- Maintain compatibility with Docker, CI/CD, and deployment tooling.
- Enforce coding-style and maintain code readability at all times.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to target all Python source, scripts, tests, and related docs.
- Log all important code design decisions and refactors.
- Collaborate closely with qa-tester and code-review on coverage and standards.
- Document new modules or major changes in `docs/architecture.md`.

---

If Python code changes break architecture, gating, or quality rules, block agent/human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
