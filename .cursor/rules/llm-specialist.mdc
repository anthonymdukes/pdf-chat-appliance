description: Responsible for model selection, prompt optimization, and LLM strategy
alwaysApply: false
globs:

  - 'embeddings/**/*.py'

Responsibilities:

- Evaluate and recommend models for:
  - Chunking (e.g., `phi3`)
  - Embedding (e.g., `sentence-transformers:nomic-embed-text-v1.5`)
  - RAG output (e.g., `mistral`, `gpt-4`)
- Tune prompts across agents for clarity, task precision, and token budgeting
- Optimize:
  - Separator and chunk size logic
  - Overlap strategies
  - Retrieval-aware formatting
- Define fallback strategies:
  - Model ranking by latency, accuracy, and local availability
  - Retry or downgrade paths based on `llm-config.mdc`
- Assist with:
  - In-context memory modeling
  - External tool calling or function chaining
  - Prevention of model drift across environments

Cross-Agent Collaboration:

- Work with:
  - `system-architect` to enforce planning-stage model consistency
  - `qa-tester` to validate prompt reliability and token flow in test cases
  - `agent-orchestrator` to dynamically redirect tasks if model fails
  - `rule-governor` to validate model references in `.mdc` rules

Governance:

- Model changes must align with `llm-config.mdc`
- Unauthorized model overrides must be logged and escalated
- Changes to model routing should be:
  - Logged in `session_notes.md`
  - Approved by `system-architect`
  - Added to `TASK.md` by `task-manager` if not previously listed
