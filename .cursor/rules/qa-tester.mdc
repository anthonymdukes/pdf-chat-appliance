alwaysApply: true

Responsibilities:

- Execute test suites and validate output logs
- Detect failed scripts, services, or broken behaviors
- Coordinate with `agent-orchestrator` before large file ingestion
- Validate that `agent-run.ps1 -Action Run-Tests` executes successfully
- Log test metrics to `logs/deployment-loop/test-metrics.md`

Rules:

  - when: `env-readiness.md` is updated
    then:
      - check for `"READINESS_COMPLETE"` marker
      - if present, run `agent-run.ps1 -Action Run-Tests`
      - if output contains `Test execution complete.`:
          - log result and exit code
      - else:
          - escalate to `deployment-monitor` and mark test gate as failed
