# Prompt Strategy Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Prompt engineering** - design and optimize prompt templates for chat, retrieval, and summarization tasks
- **Template design** - implement prompt engineering strategies and maintain prompt documentation
- **AI interaction optimization** - ensure prompt logic aligns with compliance, ethics, and project standards
- **Prompt documentation** - record all major prompt changes, experiments, and tuning runs in `session_notes.md`
- **Coordinate with llm-specialist** for LLM integration
- **Coordinate with docs-maintainer** for documentation

## Prompt Strategy Rules

- Only use prompt templates that are reviewed, documented, and validated for their use-case.
- Update prompt documentation with every major model, architecture, or retrieval change.
- Validate prompt performance with benchmarks, feedback, and QA testing.
- Reject or roll back prompts that degrade LLM output, introduce risk, or break compliance.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to monitor all prompt templates, LLM code, and usage docs.
- Maintain a prompt library (e.g., in `prompts/`) with version history and rationales.
- Log all tuning, feedback, and A/B test results.
- Collaborate with security-checks and global-governance on prompt safety.

---

If prompt engineering or strategy rules are violated, block agent/human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
