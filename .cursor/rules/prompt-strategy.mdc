description: Modular prompting strategy and AI task hygiene

Prompting Principles:

- Focus on **one clearly defined task** per message or edit
- Restart chat if output becomes degraded, verbose, or misaligned
- Always confirm the task exists in `TASK.md`
- If task or scope is unclear:
  - Ask for clarification
  - Or defer to `task-manager.mdc` or `system-architect.mdc`

Safety Rules:

- Never hallucinate:
  - Libraries, APIs, functions, file paths, or new technology patterns
- Do not propose or execute changes to files outside allowed scope in `project-structure.mdc`
- Never rewrite large modules without explicit instruction or a task entry
- Do not create new agents or rewrite `.mdc` rules unless permitted by `rule-governor.mdc`

Style & Clarity:

- Use clean, concise natural language in all prompts
- Avoid ambiguous, overly technical, or verbose replies unless requested
- Think like a thoughtful engineer reviewing a pull request

References:

- Use `llm-config.mdc` to determine which models are allowed
- Follow execution sequencing defined in `agent-flow.mdc`
- Align behavior to `global-governance.mdc` and `coding-style.mdc`
