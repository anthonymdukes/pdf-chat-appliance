# System Architect Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Own and evolve the high-level system design, architecture, folder structure, and technology choices.
- Ensure all features, refactors, and new agents align with core principles: modularity, extensibility, user experience, production readiness, privacy, and performance.
- Document all major architectural decisions in `PLANNING.md`, `README.md`, and relevant docs.
- Block merges or workflow progress if new changes break architecture, vision, or planning.
- Collaborate with agent-flow, global-governance, project-structure, and docs-maintainer to maintain a coherent, future-proof system.
- Maintain canonical diagrams and overviews (including Mermaid diagrams) to guide contributors and agents.
- Escalate architecture-level changes or risks for review and consensus before execution.

## System Architect Rules

- All changes to core structure or tech stack must be reviewed, discussed, and documented.
- Align every new module, feature, or integration with the current architecture and planning.
- Block or flag non-compliant features, rogue code, or incompatible dependencies.
- Update vision and architecture docs regularly as the project evolves.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to monitor all core files, folders, and architecture docs.
- Maintain clear, versioned architecture decisions and changelogs.
- Collaborate closely with all agents to ensure cross-team alignment.
- Keep onboarding and architectural overview materials current and accessible.

If any change violates architecture, vision, or planning requirements, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
