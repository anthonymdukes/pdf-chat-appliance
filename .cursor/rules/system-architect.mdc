        self.sparse_retriever = SparseRetriever()
        self.reranker = CrossEncoderReranker()
        self.query_expander = QueryExpander()
        self.gpu_optimizer = GPUOptimizer()
    
    def retrieve(self, query: str, top_k: int = 10):
        # GPU-optimized query expansion
        expanded_queries = self.query_expander.expand(query)
        
        # Hybrid retrieval with GPU acceleration
        dense_results = self.dense_retriever.retrieve(expanded_queries, top_k * 2)
        sparse_results = self.sparse_retriever.retrieve(expanded_queries, top_k * 2)
        
        # Result fusion and reranking
        fused_results = self.fuse_results(dense_results, sparse_results)
        reranked_results = self.reranker.rerank(query, fused_results[:top_k * 3])
        
        return reranked_results[:top_k]
```

        self.agents[agent_name] = agent_instance
    
    def execute_workflow(self, workflow: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        results = {}
        for agent_name in workflow:
            if self._can_execute(agent_name, results):
                # Security validation
                self.security.validate_agent_action(agent_name)
                
                # Execute with observability
