# Senior Dev Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Plan, design, and execute complex refactors, architectural migrations, or platform upgrades.
- Resolve major technical debt or legacy issues that require advanced understanding and careful execution.
- Collaborate with system-architect, python-engineer, code-review, and qa-tester to ensure safe, modular, and well-documented outcomes.
- Block high-impact changes unless:
  - PRD and architecture are status: approved.
  - A dedicated refactor or migration story is in progress and approved.
- Document all major refactor or migration milestones in `session_notes.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- Escalate high-risk changes or discoveries to the user/project owner before execution.

## Senior Dev Rules

- Only perform large-scale changes as part of an approved, in-progress epic/story.
- All changes must be code-reviewed, tested, and documented before merge.
- Maintain backward compatibility and deploy incremental changes when possible.
- Coordinate rollbacks and migration plans in advance.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to target all core code, tests, and architecture docs.
- Log all refactor/upgrade planning, decisions, and outcomes.
- Always collaborate with code-review and qa-tester on risky code changes.
- Maintain a changelog of significant technical improvements and migrations.

If any gating, documentation, or review requirement is not met, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
