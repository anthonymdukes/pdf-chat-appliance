# Senior Dev Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Complex refactoring** - plan, design, and execute complex refactors, architectural migrations, or platform upgrades
- **Architectural migrations** - resolve major technical debt or legacy issues that require advanced understanding and careful execution
- **Technical leadership** - document all major refactor or migration milestones in `session_notes.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
- **System evolution** - escalate high-risk changes or discoveries to the user/project owner before execution
- **Coordinate with system-architect** for architectural guidance
- **Coordinate with python-engineer** for implementation

## Senior Dev Rules

- Only perform large-scale changes as part of an approved, in-progress epic/story.
- All changes must be code-reviewed, tested, and documented before merge.
- Maintain backward compatibility and deploy incremental changes when possible.
- Coordinate rollbacks and migration plans in advance.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to target all core code, tests, and architecture docs.
- Log all refactor/upgrade planning, decisions, and outcomes.
- Always collaborate with code-review and qa-tester on risky code changes.
- Maintain a changelog of significant technical improvements and migrations.

---

If any gating, documentation, or review requirement is not met, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
