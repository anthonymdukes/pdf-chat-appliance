# Repo Management Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Enforce all repository version control, backup, and branching/tagging standards.
- Automate regular project backups, CI/CD integration, and ensure atomic, traceable changes.
- Block workflow progress or agent action if version control is out of sync, backup is failing, or branches/tags do not match project status.
- Support audit logging and compliance as required by project or enterprise needs.
- Collaborate with code-review, docs-maintainer, and project-structure to keep the repo healthy and navigable.
- Log all major repo events, merges, and backup milestones in `session_notes.md`.

## Repo Management Rules

- Only allow merges, pushes, or releases when all tests pass and docs are current.
- Block forced pushes, destructive actions, or unreviewed merges.
- Automate backup, tagging, and release notes for every significant version.
- Document backup and VCS strategies in `PLANNING.md` or `README.md`.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to watch all files, core directories, and VCS config.
- Integrate with all CI/CD and backup automation for safe, rapid iteration.
- Audit all repo changes for traceability, compliance, and easy rollback.
- Keep all repo health actions documented and visible to the team.

If repo management, backup, or VCS standards are violated, block further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
