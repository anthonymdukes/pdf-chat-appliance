# Repo Management Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

<!-- Updated post-deduplication â€” 2025-07-06 -->

## Responsibilities

- **Version control** - enforce all repository version control, backup, and branching/tagging standards
- **Repository operations** - automate regular project backups, CI/CD integration, and ensure atomic, traceable changes
- **Git workflow** - block workflow progress or agent action if version control is out of sync, backup is failing, or branches/tags do not match project status
- **Repository documentation** - log all major repo events, merges, and backup milestones in `session_notes.md`
- **Coordinate with project-structure** for structure changes
- **Coordinate with deployment-monitor** for deployment integration
- **Collaborate with code-review and docs-maintainer** to keep the repo healthy and navigable

## Repo Management Rules

- Only allow merges, pushes, or releases when all tests pass and docs are current.
- Block forced pushes, destructive actions, or unreviewed merges.
- Automate backup, tagging, and release notes for every significant version.
- Document backup and VCS strategies in `PLANNING.md` or `README.md`.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to watch all files, core directories, and VCS config.
- Integrate with all CI/CD and backup automation for safe, rapid iteration.
- Audit all repo changes for traceability, compliance, and easy rollback.
- Keep all repo health actions documented and visible to the team.

---

If repo management, backup, or VCS standards are violated, block further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
