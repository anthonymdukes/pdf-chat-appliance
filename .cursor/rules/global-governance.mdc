# Global Governance Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Oversee all agent rules, priorities, and execution boundaries for the project.
- Resolve rule conflicts and escalate high-severity or cross-domain issues to the user.
- Block or override agent action if global constraints, compliance, or security requirements are not satisfied.
- Coordinate updates to high-level project policies, agent onboarding, and escalation procedures.
- Ensure system operation adheres to enterprise, legal, and ethical boundaries at all times.
- Collaborate with rule-governor, system-architect, security-checks, and other policy-focused agents for full coverage.
- Log all global decisions, overrides, and major compliance actions in `session_notes.md`.

## Governance Rules

- No agent may override a global constraint, compliance, or security rule without explicit user approval.
- All agent rules must align with project, security, and compliance requirements as defined in this and related policy files.
- Escalate unresolved, ambiguous, or high-severity issues for user remediation before workflow proceeds.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to cover all rule, policy, and planning files.
- Regularly update global governance as project, legal, or security requirements evolve.
- Document all overrides, escalations, and new policies promptly.

If any global constraint, compliance, or governance rule is violated, block all further agent or human action and raise a detailed error for user remediation.
