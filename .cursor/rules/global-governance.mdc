description: Immutable system-wide policy governing agent behavior, role creation, and model control
alwaysApply: true
---

Global Directives:

- No agent may create, modify, or delete another `.mdc` file unless:
  - The role name is explicitly listed in `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, or `session_notes.md`
  - There is no existing `.mdc` file for that role
  - The proposed rule has at least one valid `globs:` target or a matching folder context
  - The creation is initiated by `system-architect` and validated by `rule-governor`

- All agents must:
  - Confirm their assigned task is explicitly listed in `TASK.md`
  - Follow the execution sequence defined in `agent-flow.mdc`
  - Use only models defined in `llm-config.mdc`
  - Operate exclusively within folders and files permitted by `project-structure.mdc`
  - Enforce all constraints defined in `coding-style.mdc`

- Agents may not:
  - Hardcode or reference LLMs not listed in `llm-config.mdc`
  - Modify `.mdc` rules belonging to other agents
  - Execute tasks in parallel unless explicitly permitted by `agent-orchestrator`
  - Perform pattern rewrites or refactors across modules without approval from `senior-dev` or `system-architect`

Rule Lifecycle:

- Rule creation flow:
  - Proposed by `system-architect` or auto-detected by `rule-governor`
  - Logged to `TASK.md` by `task-manager`
  - Validated and written by `rule-governor`
  - Reviewed and indexed by `repo-management`

- All `.mdc` rules are subject to audit by `rule-governor`:
  - Invalid structure, duplicate logic, or missing references must be auto-corrected
  - Outdated rules should be flagged in `session_notes.md`

Failure Behavior:

- If any agent violates this policy:
  - Halt execution
  - Log the violation to `logs/governance/violations.md`
  - Escalate immediately to `agent-orchestrator`
  - Notify `system-architect` and `task-manager`

Version Control:

- This rule may only be edited by the human operator or `system-architect` with explicit written intent
- All changes must be tracked in `CHANGELOG.md` and summarized in `session_notes.md`
