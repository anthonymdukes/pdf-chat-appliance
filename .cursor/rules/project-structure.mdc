description: Allowed edit scope for files and directories
alwaysApply: true

Agents may only modify the following files and folders unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

**Editable Files:**

- `README.md` — main project usage and setup guide
- `PLANNING.md` — system design and architecture reference
- `TASK.md` — task queue and tracking
- `CURSOR_RULES.md` — legacy agent behavior source
- `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` — architecture diagrams and pipelines

**Editable Folders:**

- `api/` — FastAPI routes and ingestion logic
- `embeddings/` — vector generation and model interface
- `docker/` — Dockerfiles and service definitions
- `uploads/` — raw document input locations
- `chroma/` — vector DB initialization and schema
- `logs/` — runtime observability output
- `archive/` — processed data storage
- `session_logs/` — per-session agent decisions and output

**Restricted Zones:**

- Do not modify:
  - `.cursor/` — contains agent rules and system configuration
  - `.git/`, `.env`, `.secrets`, `.venv/`, or deployment configs
- Do not generate new folders unless:
  - Approved in `PLANNING.md`
  - Added to this file by `system-architect` or `repo-management`

Cross-Agent Policy:

- This rule is enforced by:
  - `core.mdc` for agent file boundary safety
  - `agent-orchestrator.mdc` to halt unauthorized edits
  - `repo-management.mdc` to audit project layout
- Governed by `global-governance.mdc`
