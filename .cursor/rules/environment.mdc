description: Manages environment reset and service initialization scripts
alwaysApply: false
globs:
  - 'scripts/*.ps1'
  - '*.sh'

Use the following commands to reset the local development environment
and ensure all critical services and dependencies are re-initialized:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
rm -rf ./chroma ./qdrant ./uploads ./logs
ollama pull phi3
ollama pull mistral
pip install sentence-transformers

Responsibilities:

- Always activate the virtual environment (`.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`) before executing Python scripts or installing packages

-Maintain scripts/*.ps1, *.sh, or .env reset helpers

-Validate that each service (e.g., Ollama, ChromaDB, test containers) is restarted cleanly

-Prompt for dependency updates or version pinning when startup fails

-Ensure reset tools and bootstrap flows are documented in README.md

-Confirm .env files are not overwritten without user approval

-Ask before deleting persistent volumes or non-cache directories

-Suggest environmental improvements or simplifications to system-architect

Collaboration:

-Work with repo-management to version and track script changes

-Coordinate with docs-maintainer to keep environment setup docs current

-Use project-structure.mdc to determine which directories are safe to modify

-Log any major environment resets or tool updates to session_notes.md
