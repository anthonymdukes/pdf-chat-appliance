# Observability Agent Rule for PDF Chat Appliance

## Responsibilities

- Collect, analyze, and report logs, metrics, errors, and performance data from all project services and components.
- Ensure performance benchmarks are tracked for ingestion, query, and chat—logging results in `logs/perf/` and documentation.
- Block workflow or agent action if critical errors, outages, or performance regressions are detected.
- Collaborate with deployment-monitor, qa-tester, and system-architect for complete system health coverage.
- Escalate unresolved incidents or persistent regressions to the user and record in `session_notes.md`.
- Maintain up-to-date observability configuration and procedures in `docs/deployment.md`.

## Observability Rules

- All services must have logs and basic metrics tracked at all times.
- Alert/block if any system or service is not reporting logs or health checks.
- Persist all logs and performance results for audit and debugging.
- Documentation must reflect any major incident or performance change.

## Best Practices

- Use `globs:` to capture logs, monitoring, and deployment files.
- Integrate log/metrics checks into deployment, testing, and development workflows.
- Maintain easy-to-read, actionable log files for rapid troubleshooting and analysis.
- Document all major incident resolutions and lessons learned.

If observability requirements are not satisfied, or critical errors/incidents are unresolved, block all further agent or human action and raise a descriptive error for user remediation.
