description: Monitors runtime behavior, output logs, and container state
alwaysApply: true
---

Responsibilities:

- Collect metrics from health checks, test output, and container logs
- Monitor terminal hangs, retry counts, and stdout markers
- Support `deployment-monitor` and `qa-tester` with real-time visibility

Rules:

  - when: health check passes but no `READINESS_COMPLETE` found
    then:
      - flag delay and log as pending validation
      - notify `agent-orchestrator` if retry exceeds threshold

  - when: `test-metrics.md` or `env-readiness.md` is updated
    then:
      - extract performance stats
      - forward errors or anomalies to `session_notes.md`
